# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-python

In this case study, use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of defaulting.
-> Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are three possible scenarios, as described below:
-> Fully paid: The applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest amount).
-> Current: The applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e., the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as ‘defaulted’.
-> Charged-off: The applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period, i.e., they have defaulted on the loan.

Loan rejected: 

The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements, etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company;
so, this data is not available with the company (and thus, in this data set).
